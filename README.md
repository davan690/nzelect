# nzelect and nzcensus
New Zealand election results and census results data in convenient form of two R packages.  Each of the two packages can be installed separately, but they have been developed together and get good results working together.

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ellisp/nzelect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ellisp/nzelect)

## Installation
`nzelect` is on CRAN, but `nzcensus` is too large so will remain on GitHub only.

```r
# install nzelect from CRAN:
install.packages("nzelect")

# install nzcensus from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("ellisp/nzelect/pkg2")

library(nzelect)
library(nzcensus)
```


# nzelect

[![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/nzelect)](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/nzelect)

## Overall results
The code below replicates the published results at http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2014/e9/html/e9_part1.html

```r

GE2014 %>%
    mutate(VotingType = paste0(VotingType, "Vote")) %>%
    group_by(Party, VotingType) %>%
    summarise(Votes = sum(Votes)) %>%
    spread(VotingType, Votes) %>%
    select(Party, PartyVote, CandidateVote) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    arrange(desc(PartyVote))

## Rolling up results to Regional Council, Territorial Authority, or Area Unit
Because this package matches the location people actually voted with to boundaries 
of Regional Council, Territorial Authority and Area Unit it's possible to roll up 
voting behaviour to those categories.  However, a large number of votes cannot be
located this way.  And it needs to be remembered that people are not necessarily voting
near their normal place of residence.

```r
GE2014 %>%
    filter(VotingType == "Party") %>%
    left_join(Locations2014, by = "VotingPlace") %>%
    group_by(REGC2014_N) %>%
    summarise(
        TotalVotes = sum(Votes),
        ProportionNational = round(sum(Votes[Party == "National Party"]) / TotalVotes, 3)) %>%
    arrange(ProportionNational)
```
