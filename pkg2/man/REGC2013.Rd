Variables have been selected in a somewhat ad hoc fashion.  For example, not
all forms of travelling to work are shown; the same applies to occupations,
industries, etc.  Generally the focus has been on place of residence than
of work.  The aim is to provide a convenient collection of variables rather 
than to be comprehensive.
